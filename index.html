    <h2 id="title">Three streetwear styles for SS 2019</h2>

    <h4 id="date">19th March 2019</h3>

    <h3>Cycling Shorts</h4>

    <p>
      The first streetwear style to prevail on the catwalks is cycling shorts.
      Of course, the return of the cycling short is nothing new – it has been a
      prominent trend for a few seasons now. Kim Kardashian West was channelling
      the retro trend, rebranding them from how they were worn decades ago (in
      bright neon hues and teamed with trainers and oversized T-shirts) by
      wearing them in more revealing ways and with sky-high heels. Fellow
      celebrities, from Kendall Jenner to Gigi Hadid, have since followed suit.

    <h3>Cargo Trousers</h5>

      <p>
        What else for streetwear? Well, we called it: cargo pants are on. Big
        pocketed, tough fastening cargo pants in khaki and muted military colours.
        Some were tapered in the leg, most were high waisted. Long trailing belts
        completed the look, even more so worn with a pair of heels. The style has
        increased 103% in retail in the last three months – hold tight as this one
        will only grow more for Spring 2019.

    <h3>Animal Prints</h6>

      <p>
        The last trend to look out for is animal print - leopard print, snakeskin,
        cow hide, deer hide, crocodile print, tiger print, zebra print…they were
        all there on the Spring 2019 runways, so cast your animal print fears
        aside and get close to the wild.Classic leopard is the easiest route to
        take on the mass market, though Off-White’s neon snakeskin will be riffed aplenty.
